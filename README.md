# pong-game

Pong is a classic arcade game, probably one of the first arcade 
games that ever was. Itâ€™s basically just a ball going across a table 
and two players each control a paddle bouncing the ball back and 
forth. If you miss the ball then the other player scores a point. 
Also, the speed of the ball starts increasing time to time.
